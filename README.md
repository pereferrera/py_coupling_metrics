# Code metrics (WIP)

Misc. software metrics for python. Concretely, some metrics that I didn't find
implemented in other tools like instability analysis metrics:
* Afferent coupling
* Efferent coupling
* Instability
* Abstracness
* Distance to main sequence

It also generates a PlantUML diagram of the analyzed project.
